# `mloop` - Loop playing music in a given directory

## What?

I wrote this small tool to tease my noisy neighbors with my music in the morning.

It loops playing audio files in the given directory, in either lexico or random order.

## Usage

```shell
mloop -dir <audio-file-dir> -start <play-start-time> -duration 30m
```

## Build

```shell
git clone 
```
